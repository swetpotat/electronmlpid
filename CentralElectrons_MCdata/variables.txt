----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is information on the definition of each of the variables used in this analysis
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They are a mixture of signal (from Tag-and-Probe selection on Z->ee events) and background 
(from W/Z-veto selection on jet-jet events). 

The variables for each event are listed below, subdivided by category. Those with a "*" are 
those which are NOT included in the likelihood PID (LH_Value).


TRACKING VARIALBES:
-------------------

### Track Conditions ###

p_numberOfInnermostPixelHits - number of hits in the innermost pixel layer; discriminates against photon conversions
p_numberOfPixelHits - number of hits in the pixel detector
p_numberOfSCTHits - number of total hits in the pixel and SCT detectors
p_d0 - transverse impact parameter with respect to the beam line
p_d0Sig - significance of transverse impact parameter defined as the ratio of d0 and its uncertainty
p_dPOverP - momentum lost by the track between the perigee and the least measurement point divided by the original momentum

### Track Cluster Matching ###

p_deltaEta1 - deltaEta between the cluster position in the strip layer and the extrapolated track
p_deltaPhiRescaled2 - defined as deltaPhi2 (deltaPhi between cluster position in the middle layer and the track extrapolated from the perigee) but
       		      the track momentum is rescaled to the cluster energy
p_EptRatio - ratio of the cluster energy to the track momentum
p_TRTPID - ???
p_numberOfTRTHits* - number of hits in the TRT detector in total
p_TRTTrackOccupancy* - measure of the occupancy/activity in the direction of the electron candidate
p_numberOfTRTXenonHits* - not all TRT hits are in straws with xenon, which is the gas used for electron PID


CALORIMETER VARIABLES:
----------------------

### Hadronic Leakage ###

p_Rhad1 - ratio of Et in the first layer of the hadronic calorimeter to Et of the EM cluster (used over the range abs(eta) < 0.8 or abs(eta) > 1.37)
p_Rhad - ratio of Et in the hadronic calorimeter to Et of the EM cluster (used over the range 0.8 < abs(eta) < 1.37)

### Back Layer of EM Calorimeter ###

p_f3 - ratio of the energy in the back layer to the total energy in the EM accordion calorimeter (only used below 100 GeV because known to be
       inefficient at high energies)

### Middle Layer of EM Calorimeter ###

p_weta2 - lateral shower width
p_Rphi - ratio of energy in 3x3 cells over the energy in 3x7 cells centered at electron cluster position
p_Reta - ratio of energy in 3x7 cells over the energy in 7x7 cells centered at electron cluster position

### Strip Layer of EM Calorimeter ###

p_Eratio - ratio of the energy difference between the largest and second largest energy deposits in the cluster over the sum of these energies
p_f1 - ratio of the energy in the strip layer to the total energy in the EM accordion calorimeter
p_eta* - kinematic variable giving the direction of the electron candidate

### Pileup Information ###

averageInteractionsPerCrossing* - provided by LHC (used instead of actualInteractionsPerCrossing since this variable had negative values)
